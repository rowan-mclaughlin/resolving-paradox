by T. Rowan McLaughlin, Harry K. Robson, Rikke Maring, Adam Boethius, Eric Guiry, Daniel Gro√ü, Satu Koivisto, Bente Philippsen, Nicky Milner, Geoff Bailey and Oliver E. Craig.


The R code contained in this repository enables the replicaiton of the analysis and modelling described in this paper. 


In addition to the R code here, the DEMRE database will need to be downloaded into the working directory -- see doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14019080. 


This repository contains the following documents:


SI_Markdown.Rmd -- R code (Markdown format) for replicating the analysis, and supplementary information

SI_Markdown.pdf -- As above, compiled in to a PDF document

ABM.R -- Agent-based model simulation described in section 4.3

Figs.R -- Code to replicate the figures in the paper once the code in SI_Markdown.Rmd has seen executed


The following support files are also needed for some of the code to run correctly:

Denmark_UTM_buffered_5km.* -- Shapefile of the Danish coastline buffered by 5km

Robson_et_al_OxCal.rData -- Posterior probability distributions of cereamic artefacts (from Robson et al 2021 the https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jasrep.2021.102829)

dk_fish.csv -- .csv version of fish zooarchaeological finds in Denmark, derived from the data available in the DEMRE database

dk_marine_mam.csv -- .csv version of 

dk_smr.csv -- Details of extant shell midden sites in Denmark, taken from the Fund og Fortidsminder (https://www.kulturarv.dk/fundogfortidsminder/)
